DAL_Specifics
Data Access Layer (Specific Cases)
Provides the core functionality to support specific cases of Acquire, Parse, (Filter) sections of Fry's framework.
All functions/classes here handle turning a specific type of data source into a dataset or internal object(s) (of type Y).

These are separate for DAL_Core, so that when the data source definitions (e.g. design of a scraped public website) change, the core functionality does not need to change



e.g.
function RetrieveEdubaseDataset(sURN as string) as Dataset
	'uses the HTML URI crawling of the DAL_Core library.

end function
